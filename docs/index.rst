exoplanet Case Studies
======================

These pages contain "case studies" for `the exoplanet project
<https://docs.exoplanet.codes>`_. Each case study is an example of a real world
application of the ``exoplanet`` library for analyzing data in astronomy. They
are implemented as Jupyter notebooks, and you can download the notebook or
launch it using `Binder <https://mybinder.org>`_ using the menus at the top
right of each case study. Note that the run time for some of these notebooks can
be as long as an hour, but we've tried to keep the studies as self-contained and
reproducible as possible.
