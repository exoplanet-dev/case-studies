exoplanet: Case Studies
=======================

These pages contain "case studies" for `the exoplanet project
<https://docs.exoplanet.codes>`_. Each case study is an example of a real world
application of the ``exoplanet`` library for analyzing data in astronomy. They
are implemented as Jupyter notebooks, and you can download the notebook or
launch it using `Binder <https://mybinder.org>`_ using the menus at the top
right of each case study.

For more information about ``exoplanet``, check out the main documentation page
at `docs.exoplanet.codes <https://docs.exoplanet.codes>`_.

   :class: hint

   ‚è∞ Note that the runtime for some of these notebooks can be as long as half an
   hour, but we've tried to keep the studies as self-contained and reproducible
   as possible. This computation is generally dominated by the sampling step so
   if you want to get a rough sense of the expected runtime for a particular
   case study, scroll down to take a look at the progress bar generated by the
   call to the ``sample`` function.

   üêõ If you run into bugs when executing these case studies (or variations on
   them) on your own computer, `open an issue on the exoplanet GitHub repo
   <https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/exoplanet/issues>`_.

   üí° If you have a conceptual issue or a particularly tricky or interesting
   fit, `start a discussion
   <https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/exoplanet/discussions>`_ on GitHub so that
   we can all learn together.
